# MWEs
Multi-word expression resources created as part of my MSc dissertation at the University of Leeds.

## Lists
Three lists of MWE candidates are made available, automatically scored for semantic compositionality using word2vec embeddings, based on the methodology of Roberts & Egg (2018) - https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1046/

They are drawn from a 10% sample of sentences in the English Wikipedia dump from 20 May 2020.

wiki10pc_comp.tsv      - Principal list of bi- and tri-gram candidates
wiki10pc_tag_comp.tsv  - Candidates with POS tags assigned using the Stanford tagger
wiki10pc_nopn_comp.tsv - POS-tagged candidates, with proper nouns excluded

## Code
Python utilities constructed as part of the above work.

## Project
Further code and Jupyter notebooks used in the work; less likely to be re-usable without modification.
