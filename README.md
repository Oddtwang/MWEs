# MWEs
Multi-word expression resources created as part of my MSc dissertation at the University of Leeds.

## Lists
Two lists of MWE candidates are made available, automatically scored for semantic compositionality using word2vec embeddings, based on the methodology of Roberts & Egg (2018) - https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1046/

They are drawn from a 10% sample of sentences in the English Wikipedia dump from 20 May 2020.

## Code
Python utilities constructed as part of the above work.
